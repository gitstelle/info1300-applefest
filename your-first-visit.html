        <h1>Your First Visit</h1>
        <h2 class>A Typical Day at Applefest</h2>
        <!-- PARAGRAPH IS INSTRUCTOR PROVIDED -->
        <p>
            Going to Applefest for the first time can feel overwhelming because of all the available foods, crafts, and
            entertainment available this weekend! There is no particular or best way to explore Applefest, but this is a
            good starting point if you are curious about what an average day may look for a visitor.
        </p>
        <!-- I WROTE THIS -->
        <p>
            You arrive around 11:45 AM to the Commons with your friends to get a good spot to watch the first performer
            of the day at Berton Milton Pavillion. After the concert, you explore the food vendors and get lunch and
            find a shady spot in the Commons to eat. Since you are at an Apple Festival, you make sure to buy some
            apples to take home, but also drink apple cider and various apple baked goods. You go to the Craft Fair part
            of the festival and meet the various local talented artists and perhaps pick up some souvenirs for your
            friends and family. To test your luck and skill, you play some games and even win a prize! When the day is
            over, you and your friends take the TCAT home having known the Ithaca area better, great memories and
            photos, and more to explore tomorrow.

        <h3>How much money should I bring?</h3>
        <p>
            Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if
            anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the
            parking garage (You can find more parking information here ). If you plan to eat at the festival, you may
            also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many
            of our vendors and their items can be found here.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I pay with a credit card?</h3>
        <p>
            Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are
            interested in does not accept them.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I bring my dog?</h3>
        <p>Bringing a dog is strongly discouraged due to pets not being allowed on the Commons. Additionally, the event
            will be crowded and may be overwhelming for your furry friend, or it may be difficult to move through the
            crowds. Registered service animals are permitted.</p>
        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
        <p>
            If you are not familiar with the Ithaca area, it can get quite cold in the fall! Check the weather and bring
            layers.
        </p>
        <h3>When is the best time to attend?</h3>
        <p> If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find
            that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.</p>

        <h3>Will there be alcohol?</h3>
        <p>
            Some vendors do sell alcohol (such as hard cider), so be sure to bring your ID if you are over 21. Many of
            these
            vendors also offer tastings.
